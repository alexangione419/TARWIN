# TARWIN
TARWIN (Transmit And Recieve Weather Information Now) is a proof-of-concept model of a warning system designed for areas lacking early natural disaster warning equipment. The full project consists of a transmitter device and a reciever device. These devices revolved around RF 433MHz Transmitter and Reciever Modules, with each part being placed in its respective device.

The user would push one of four buttons on the transmitter device and depending on which button, the correspoding LED would light up on the reciever and a buzzer would sound.
