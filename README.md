TARWIN (Transmit And Recieve Weather Information Now) is a proof-of-concept model of a warning system designed for areas lacking early natural disaster warning equipment. The full project consists of a transmitter device and a reciever device. These devices revolved around RF 433MHz Transmitter and Reciever Modules, with each part being placed in its respective device.
